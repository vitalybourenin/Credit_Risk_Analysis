# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to train and evaluate machine learning models using different resampling methods to predict credit risk. Our models took into consideration a number of variables, including but not limited to the dollar amount of the loan, interest rates, and annual income, to predict if the loan should be considered high-risk or low-risk. We can analyze the results of these models in order to determine which is the best model for predicting credit risk.
